    "# Sacramento Homeless Management Information System Data Summary\n",
    "Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data captures client-level information about housing services and other homelessness prevention services provided those acutely experiencing homlessness or who are at risk of homelessness. These data are for the Sacramento County continuum of care and are current through fall of 2019. Data quality prior to 2015 is variable as the system used to collect information was modified in January 2014. The initial goals of this project are to present these data in an interactive web format to allow users to better understand trends in homelessness in our region. The following python code attempts to merge and summarize the data in preparation for visualization for the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summarize and visualize the movement of clients on an annual basis--eventually this would ideally be sub-annual (i.e., quarterly/monthly basis).\n",
    "2. Summarize and visualize the volume of clients served by various programs and their outcomes, particuarly what proportion of recorded exits are to temporary  or permanent housing \n",
    "3. Summarize and visualize volume and movement of clients in and out of programs broken down by demographic characteristics including, but not limited to gender, race/ethnicity, veteran status, age groups, etc. "
